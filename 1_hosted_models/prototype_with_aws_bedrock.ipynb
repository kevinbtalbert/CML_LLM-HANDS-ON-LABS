As an example, we will provide instruction to the foundational model to summarize, in a few bullet points, a chunk of a text.  Model instructions typically follow a prescribed pattern and depend on the model used. In other words, the is no standard way to provide insturctions to different models. Below we follow [Anthropic's suggested structure](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/constructing-a-prompt). For example, note the use of keywords `Human:` and `Assistant:`.
